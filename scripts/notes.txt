I have attached a PYQ (Previous Year Questions) paper PDF for [SUBJECT NAME]. 

Please analyze this PDF and add it as a new subject to our existing PYQ web application with EXACTLY the same UI/UX as the current DELD subject.

**Requirements:**

   - Subject name: [SUBJECT NAME]
   - Subject code: [SUBJECT CODE if available]
   - Same card design and hover effects as DELD

3. **Maintain exact same features:**
   - Question filtering by year
   - Question filtering by marks
   - Search functionality
   - Tag-based categorization
   - Bookmark feature
   - Smart recommendation system
   - Practice mode
   - Same color scheme and animations

4. **Organize questions by topics/units** as mentioned in the PDF

5. **Add subject-specific tags** based on the question content

6. **Provide complete updated code** for:
