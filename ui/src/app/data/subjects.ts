    description:
      "Covers the mathematical foundations essential for computer science — from propositional and predicate logic through set theory, relations, and algebraic structures to graph theory and combinatorics. Problems focus on proof techniques, group/ring identification, graph algorithms, and recurrence relation solving.",
    studyTip:
      "Propositional logic proofs and equivalence tables are quick-scoring. Practice Hasse diagram construction for posets and lattice identification. In graph theory, focus on Euler/Hamilton path conditions, graph coloring, and tree properties. Solving recurrence relations using characteristic equations is a high-frequency pattern.",
